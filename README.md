# Vue (2.x) Data Reactivity Sample

A simple application demonstrating some reactive features of Vue.

* Computed properties that re-calculate when dependent data is changed.
* Watchers that can trigger a function to update other data.
* Passing computed data into child components to show the data updates
  automatically flow through.

Also:
* Using a shared global store for data.
